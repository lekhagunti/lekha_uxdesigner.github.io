<p class="conheading"> Problem statement </p>
<p class="con">Every day we undergo through so many emotions, problems and dilemmatic situations where we take suggestions and advices
from people we trust like family, friends and colleagues. But sometimes we want these suggestions or advices from people
who have undergone through similar situations and maybe we want to share emotions with people whom we don’t know. In
such conditions we definitely can use the internet as a perfect platform to find new people with whom we can ccommunicate in order to overcome through our problems, but this may results in security issues and fraudulent experiences. <br>
To solve this issue to an extent I have come up with the application named warmth where we can communicate with strangers who have undergone
similar situation and share our emotions or even give advices or suggestion to others without revealing your details apart
from name.</p> <br>

willing to share with their loved ones or acquaintances rather are willing to share with strangers who have undergone
similar emotions. Users are in psychologically disturbed state who are looking out for help from people similar to
themselves.</li> <nl>
<li><b>Motive of the user:</b>Any user who feels to share his/ her emotions of all kinds or would like to get or give suggestions and advices in their
area of interests are potential users of the Warmth Application.</li> <nl>

<p class="conheading"> Challenge faced </p>
<p class="con">The main challenge faced while designing this application is how to make the communication between the users secured, where the user who wants help from others  or want to share his/ her opinions and feelings, he/ she should be able to do the same safely without revealing personal details unwillingly. <nl>I was able to overcome this challenge by designing sharing emotion as a post rather than normal chat process so that only people who are interested in helping the person can join the group and continue their communication in a separate group which results in first level of security and further who joins the group and communicates cannot see the group head or any other participant's details apart from their names.</nl></p>

<p class="conheading"> Problem statement </p>
<p class="con">Animals cannot speak like humans but they can express unconditional love better than humans, this is a fact. Also,
according to studies, having a pet reduces stress in our lives to a great extent. There are so many dogs and cats on our
streets which thrive for their lives, get injured, starve and eventually die. Some of them find their way to animal
shelters and lead the rest of their lives without any purpose. on the otherhand every person who wants a pet looks for costly and prestigious breeds, pay
huge prices and buy them ,no offence though. But animals those  in shelters never get to experience true human love and care. Some
people rather are ready to adopt such animals from shelters or from doners who give away their pets due to various
reasons. For such people there must be a platform where they can find the animal centers and pet doners around them,
verify and then adopt the pet they need. <br>
Pedopt is a Web application which stages animal shelters and pet doners so that people willing to adopt these animals can
easily find and contact them for adoption. It also helps people who want to donate their pets due to their personal
reasons to find eligible owners for their pets.</p> <br>

                <p class="con">Pedopt is a simple web application, the only challenge i faced was to show the pet doners their donation post without creating private account for the users. This is because pedopt is an informational application that only provides to stage your adoption or donation and not a complete functional application. <nl>I was able to overcome this challenge by introducing <B>My post</B> tab in the settings by clicking it further opens a page that shows the donations the user has made and on the other hand if the user hasn't posted any donation of animals at all it will show <b>No Donation posts yet</b>. This made it possible to show the donations made by the user without creating a private account for it.</nl>
